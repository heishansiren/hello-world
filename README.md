# hello-world
It's just a practice about how to use GitHub. Nothing else.
My name is Hu Meng, and I'm an engineer of finite eliment simulation, especially using ANSYS software to calculate many physics field, such as electro-magnetic field, temperature field, flow field and so on.
Now I'm working and living in Shanghai. 
Welcome to contact me ^-^.
